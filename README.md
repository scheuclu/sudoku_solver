# Sudoko Solver

You can use the Sudoku Solver whenever you are stuck on a puzzle.

I support both manual input as well as input via camera or webcam.

> **Note**
> At the moment, the camera input is buggy, so you probably have to correct the results manually.


Here's a little demo of how it works.
